# Hill-Valley
A list of numbers is said to be a hill if it consists of an ascending sequence followed by a descending sequence, where each of the sequences is of length at least two. Similarly, a list of numbers is said to be a valley if it consists of an descending sequence followed by an ascending sequence. You can assume that consecutive numbers in the input sequence are always different from each other.  Write a Python function hillvalley(l) that takes a list l of integers and returns True if it is a hill or a valley, and False otherwise
